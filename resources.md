in our current era of information overload, it can be overwhelming to learn a new skill, method, or concept when we aren't sure which resource(s) to draw from. (at least, this is oftentimes the case for me!) to potentially help, below is the start of my curated list of resources which i am currently using, will use, have used, or find myself referencing regularly. eventually, i may categorize them or maybe write about example use cases in the form of blog posts, but for now this is what we're working with:
