It forces you to describe things precisely, to ask questions, to check your assumptions. It’s not unlike working in interdisciplinary research, where the same term can mean different things to different people (e.g., What is a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-020-02793-y" rel="nofollow"><em>representation</em></a>?).

But more than anything, we learned how to communicate. In the beginning, we had to talk through every detail: what move we were trying, who initiated it, where we’d make contact, and how we’d time our transitions. Communication was constant and deliberate.",Qe,V,Nt='And as we developed routines together, we also developed our own internal vocabulary. Since naming conventions in aerial aren’t standardized, especially in duo work, we created a kind of partner-specific shorthand. One example is a move we called “Tweedle Dee,” which we borrowed from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDKwNW8JBcw" rel="nofollow">a YouTube routine</a> we once saw, where the performers played Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum in an Alice in Wonderland–themed act. To anyone else, that name would be meaningless. But to us, “Tweedle Dee” instantly evoked a full sequence of coordinated movement, who was doing what and when and for how long. It was an abstraction, a compact label for something deeply embodied.',Ve,N,Xt="Over time, this vocabulary allowed us to move together more fluidly, without having to explain every detail. Eventually, we didn’t need to talk at all. By the time we performed our final duo act, we were in sync, able to anticipate each other’s timing, weight shifts, and intentions with near-perfect precision.",Ne,X,Zt="That shared understanding didn’t just make things easier, it made things better. Our routines reflected a partnership that had been built over years of trust, improvisation, and collaboration. Because our communication and movement were so tightly integrated, our performances had a kind of rhythm and playfulness that felt uniquely us. Compared to solo acts, our routines offered something more unexpected—more dynamic, more relational, more fun to watch (or so I have been told!)",Xe,Z,$t='Reflecting on this now, I’m reminded of research on coordination and shared understanding. In particular, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00077" rel="nofollow">McCarthy &amp; Hawkins, et al., 2021</a> studied how people develop their own shorthand when working together on physical tasks, much like K and I did. They found that over time, people naturally create their own language for complex movements, building up shared understanding through experience. That dynamic felt exactly like our journey: starting with careful, explicit instructions, then gradually building up our own vocabulary that let us move together seamlessly.
