          I am currently a final-year PhD candidate (expected graduation: May 2026) in the
          <a href="https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/">Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences department</a>
          at Dartmouth College, working in the
          <a href="https://cosanlab.com/">Computational Social Affective Neuroscience (COSAN) Lab</a>, where I work with
          <a href="https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/luke-j-chang">Luke J. Chang</a>
          and collaborate with
          <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/robert-hawkins">Robert Hawkins</a>
          and
          <a href="https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/jonathan-s-phillips">Jonathan Phillips</a>. See my <a href="/research">research interests</a> page for more details.</p> <p class="pt-4 text-left"><img src="images/lncc_logo.png" alt="lncc" class="w-24 float-left mr-4 dark:invert"/>
          Prior to graduate school, I worked as the lab manager of
          <a href="http://ski.clps.brown.edu/">Michael J. Frank</a>&#39;s
          <a href="https://www.lnccbrown.com/">Lab of Neural Computation + Cognition</a>. My research focused on understanding how humans learn and make
          decisions under uncertainty, particularly within the context of
          psychiatric disorders and with a specific emphasis on obsessive
          compulsive disorder (OCD).

          Before that, I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant in
          <a href="https://www.shenhavlab.org/">Amitai Shenhav&#39;s Lab</a>, where
          I studied performance monitoring and cognitive control within the
          context of task-switching.</p> <p class="pt-4 text-left">I was born in Thailand, grew up in Maine, and then lived in Rhode
          Island for several years for college and work.

          Outside of research, I enjoy ruminating while showering, cuddling with
          my kitty Joji (pictured above), and playing video games (currently
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-5RXAitTI">Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</a>
