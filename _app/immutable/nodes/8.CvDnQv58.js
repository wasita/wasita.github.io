            These processes are foundational not only for successful collaboration but also for building meaningful social connections.</p> <p class="pt-4 text-left">By developing interactive web-based paradigms that preserve experimental control while capturing real social dynamics, I investigate the cognitive mechanisms that support our ability to co-construct mental models of the world with others. I combine real-time multiplayer experiments with natural language processing (NLP) and computational cognitive modeling (primarily Bayesian inference) to understand how minds interact and coordinate in the face of uncertainty.</p></div></div></div></div></div>`,1);function c(e){var t=s();n(2),i(e,t)}export{c as component};
