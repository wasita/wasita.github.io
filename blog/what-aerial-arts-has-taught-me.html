<p>During my college’s Accepted Students Day, I saw my first partner acro performance. Something about it, maybe the challenge or the drama, instantly captivated me. It also helped that one of the first friends I made was a flying trapeze instructor, and together we motivated each other as we gradually infiltrated the campus aerial club. I kept up with aerial arts throughout college and into my post-bacc, drawn to how it demanded strength, creativity, and <em>somehow</em> made use of my stubbornness. Looking back now, I see so many parallels between my aerial practice and my approach to research. This is my attempt to put that into words.</p>
<h2>Early specialization</h2>
<p>Our college aerial club thankfully offered a few disciplines to sample when starting out: aerial hoop, trapeze, silks, rope, and partner acro. I’d always been naturally flexible but lacked strength, so anything that required me to hold myself up for long periods (i.e., everything but hoop and trapeze) wasn’t very appealing. I immediately gravitated toward aerial hoop and chose to focus on it. It was the only apparatus I ever performed on, and I have no regrets about not branching out or potentially being a “one-trick pony.”</p>
<p>The parallel here is that I learned something fundamental about myself: I’m pretty decisive about what I like and don’t like. Whether it’s based on what comes naturally or what I find intuitively enjoyable, I tend to stick to my preferences—or, to borrow some jargon from my research field, I’m “internally consistent.” That same tendency shows up in my research life, especially in the methods and approaches I gravitate toward.</p>
<p>A prime example of this is from 2017, when I saw <a href="https://eshinjolly.com/" rel="nofollow">someone</a> give a talk about their gossip study, where they built a multi-player web app. The moment I saw that, I vowed to learn web development so I could build my own multi-user interfaces someday, and that approach has since become a foundational method in my research. It’s not that I’ve mastered them, but I know what excites me and what I aspire to get better at. That sense of direction has helped keep me grounded when everything else feels uncertain.</p>
<p><img src="/images/aerial_12_2015.jpg" alt="hip hang"></p>
<h2>Hip Hang: Just Keep Trying</h2>
<p>My favorite move I taught myself was the hip hang (pictured above). It may look simple, but getting into it was a whole other story. My body didn’t understand the mechanics. I kept falling out of the move, bruising my hip again and again from the pain until a black spot bloomed where my hip met the hoop.</p>
<p>I’d fall and get frustrated. But I kept trying. And trying. And trying. Until one day, my muscles remembered what my mind couldn’t quite grasp, and I somehow just did it. Eventually, that black spot went numb. It no longer hurt.</p>
<p>Research feels the same way a lot of the time. There are stretches where you’re just banging your head against a wall, spinning your wheels, repeatedly trying things that don’t quite work. But if you keep at it long enough—adjusting here, trusting your instincts there—you eventually find the hold.</p>
<h2>Learning from Different Management Styles</h2>
<p>Being part of the aerial club’s executive board gave me a front-row seat to how different leadership styles play out in practice. For a couple of years, I served as the social media chair. I designed performance posters, created Facebook events, and coordinated with photographers for our shows. Beyond those responsibilities though, I was part of the broader decision-making team that kept the club running.</p>
<p>I wasn’t president, but I worked closely with the people who were, and each brought a distinct management style. Some were assertive and structured, quick to make executive decisions and keep things on schedule. Others were more easygoing and collaborative, creating space for input and flexibility, even if it slowed things down. I saw firsthand how those choices impacted morale, participation, and overall club efficiency. Too much rigidity could burn people out; too little direction could stall momentum. The most effective leaders found a balance, or at least knew how to adapt based on the situation.</p>
<p>Just like club presidents, PIs vary widely in how they manage people and projects. Learning how to work under (and around) different styles has helped me navigate research environments with more self-awareness and adaptability. I’ve come to understand what kind of structure helps me thrive and where I might need to create that structure for myself.</p>

<h2>Choreographing My Own Path</h2>
<p>Once I’d gotten the basics down, I started choreographing my own routines. There’s something empowering about stringing moves together into a sequence that feels truly yours. Unlike more formal dance disciplines, where a single choreographer teaches the group a set routine, aerial often invites improvisation and experimentation. You pick your own music, and you are your own choreographer.</p>
<p>I loved walking to class, earbuds in, listening to the playlist of songs I wanted to perform to. I’d imagine which transitions would sync with which lyrics, where a drop might land most dramatically, or how a pose could stretch out just long enough to catch a musical swell. It was part puzzle, part daydream, part embodiment.</p>
<p>That spirit of creating within constraints is something I try to bring to my research, too. One of the paradoxically empowering and anxiety-inducing things about graduate school is the lack of structure. Every PhD experience is “the same” in that it’s largely dependent on the individual. But learning to lean into that autonomy, to choreograph my own research journey, has helped me feel less overwhelmed by the unknown and more confident in what I can create.</p>

<em>K and I performing our “Tweedle Dee” move on the lyra (which is another name for aerial hoop!)</em></p>
<h2>Collaborating closely to form ad-hoc conventions</h2>
<p>One of the quirks of aerial, especially compared to more formalized disciplines like ballet, is that there isn’t a universal naming system.  In ballet, a <em>tendu</em> is always a <em>tendu</em>. But in aerial, the same move might be called a “gazelle,” a “stag,” or something else entirely.</p>
<p>You can imagine how this lack of standardization can be confusing or inefficient: learning and teaching moves requires you to reach a consensus on a naming convention, to reduce uncertainty. It forces you to describe things precisely, to ask questions, to check your assumptions. It’s not unlike working in interdisciplinary research, where the same term can mean different things to different people (e.g., What is a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-020-02793-y" rel="nofollow"><em>representation</em></a>?). You can’t take shared vocabulary for granted. You have to build it.</p>
<p>That lesson became especially clear when I started performing with K, my duo hoop partner for all four years of college. Reflecting on this now, performing with K is probably my longest-running collaboration to date.</p>
<p>We learned to mirror, share weight, and build shapes together. But more than anything, we learned how to communicate. In the beginning, we had to talk through every detail: what move we were trying, who initiated it, where we’d make contact, and how we’d time our transitions. Communication was constant and deliberate.</p>
<p>And as we developed routines together, we also developed our own internal vocabulary. Since naming conventions in aerial aren’t standardized, especially in duo work, we created a kind of partner-specific shorthand. One example is a move we called “Tweedle Dee,” which we borrowed from a YouTube routine we once saw, where the performers played Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum in an Alice in Wonderland–themed act. To anyone else, that name would be meaningless. But to us, “Tweedle Dee” instantly evoked a full sequence of coordinated movement: who initiated it, how it unfolded, where our weight shifted, what tempo to follow. It was an abstraction, a compact label for something deeply embodied.</p>
<p>Over time, this vocabulary allowed us to move together more fluidly, without having to explain every detail. Eventually, we didn’t need to talk at all. By the time we performed our final duo act, we were in sync from start to finish, able to anticipate each other’s timing, weight shifts, and intentions with near-perfect precision.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this now, I’m reminded of research on how people learn to coordinate through shared procedural abstractions. In particular, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00077" rel="nofollow">McCarthy et al. (2021)</a> found that when people repeatedly collaborate on a physical assembly task, they naturally begin to develop increasingly concise instructions by grounding language in shared, task-relevant conceptual structures. Over time, they form ad-hoc conventions that compress complex procedures into higher-level abstractions. That dynamic felt deeply familiar: K and I started with careful, explicit instructions, then gradually built up a shared vocabulary, rooted in mutual experience, that enabled seamless, efficient coordination. Our “Tweedle Dee” wasn’t just a name; it was a scaffold for joint understanding and collaborative movement.</p>

<h2>A Community of Misfits</h2>
<p>Aerial communities tend to attract people who never quite fit into traditional molds—queer folks, neurodivergent folks, shy people, loud people, former athletes, artists, oddballs. Everyone’s weird in their own way, and no one’s trying to hide it. That environment was one of the first where I felt truly safe to take up space.</p>
<p>In academia, finding that kind of community isn’t always easy. It can feel isolating, especially if you don’t see yourself reflected in your cohort or your field. But the aerial world gave me a blueprint: it taught me what it feels like to belong, and what it takes to create that kind of space for others.</p>
<h2>Curtain Call</h2>
<p>I don’t train as often anymore, but aerial will always be one of my first loves, and I still hope to settle down somewhere with a studio nearby. It taught me to persist through pain, to experiment boldly, to communicate clearly, and to seek out communities where I feel seen. Those lessons continue to shape how I approach my research.</p>
<p>Maybe this is an admission of vanity, but when I feel down about my ability in academia, I sometimes rewatch old aerial performance videos. I think about all the times I flailed and fell before finally getting it. I think about how progress doesn’t always look like progress until, suddenly, it does.</p>
<p>If you fall enough times, you’ll eventually fly.</p></article></div></main>
