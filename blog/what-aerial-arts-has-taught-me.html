			<p class="pb-20 text-white">Published: March 2025</p></div></div>
	<p>Maybe this is an admission of vanity, but when I feel down about my ability in academia, I sometimes rewatch my old aerial performance videos. I think about all the times I flailed and fell before finally getting it. It reminds me that learning rarely feels graceful while it’s happening.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about how deeply my years of training in aerial arts have shaped the way I approach research. Strength, resilience, choreography, communication, community—lessons I learned on the hoop continue to ground me in the lab. So here’s a reflection on what one passion taught me about another.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/clown_university.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>During my college’s Accepted Students Day, I saw my first partner acro performance. Something about it, maybe the challenge or the drama, instantly captivated me. It also helped that one of the first friends I made was a flying trapeze instructor, and together we motivated each other as we gradually infiltrated the campus aerial club. I kept up with aerial arts throughout college and into my post-bacc, drawn to how it demanded strength, creativity, and <em>somehow</em> made use of my stubbornness.</p>
<h2>Finding stability in early specialization</h2>
<p>When I first joined our college aerial club, we were encouraged to sample from a variety of disciplines: aerial hoop, trapeze, silks, rope, and partner acro. I’d always been naturally flexible but lacked upper-body strength, so anything that required me to hold myself up for long periods (i.e., everything but hoop and trapeze) wasn’t particularly appealing. I immediately gravitated toward aerial hoop and chose to focus on it. It was the only apparatus I ever performed on, and I have no regrets about not branching out or potentially being a “one-trick pony.”</p>
<p>That tendency to commit early and stick with what feels right extends beyond aerial. I’m someone who, once drawn to something, goes all in. Whether it’s based on what comes naturally or what I find intuitively enjoyable, I tend to stay loyal to my preferences—or, to borrow some jargon from my field, I’m “internally consistent.”</p>
<p>A prime example of this is from 2017, when I was an undergraduate. I saw <a href="https://eshinjolly.com/" rel="nofollow">someone</a> give a talk about their gossip study, where they built a multi-player web app. The moment I saw it, something clicked. I knew I wanted to build interfaces like that, to allow people to interact in real time, so we can study communication and coordination as they unfold.</p>
<p>That talk didn’t just inspire me, it gave me a direction. I’ve since made multi-user web apps the cornerstone of how I collect data, and I can say with absolute certainty that this is the approach I want to keep building on. It’s not that I’ve mastered it, but I know what excites me and what I aspire to get better at. That clarity has been a compass when everything else feels uncertain.</p>
<p>Having come full-circle, I now do my PhD in the same lab as the person who gave that talk. The spark I felt as an undergrad wasn’t just a passing fascination; it has evolved into a research path and a methodological identity I still feel deeply connected to.</p>
<p>And on a more practical level, it’s also become something I can rely on. If I’m feeling unmotivated or stuck in the ambiguity of an analysis, lost in the weeds of parameterizing a model or interpreting noisy results, I know I can return to the concrete, satisfying act of programming. There’s comfort in the structure of a web app: the clarity of an interface, the logic of an interaction, the visible progress of something coming together. It grounds me. It reminds me what I can build when everything else feels murky.</p>
<p><img src="/images/aerial_12_2015.jpg" alt="hip hang"></p>
<h2>Just keep trying</h2>
<p>My favorite move I taught myself was the hip hang (pictured above). It may look simple, but getting into it was a whole other story. My body didn’t understand the mechanics. Each initial attempt ended with me sliding out of the hoop, bruising my hip again and again until a dark spot bloomed where the metal pressed into bone.</p>
<p>I’d get frustrated, then try again. And again. And again. For a long time, it felt like I was just failing—like my body and the move were speaking two different languages. But then, one day, something shifted. My muscles remembered what my mind couldn’t quite grasp, and I lifted into the shape. Eventually, that bruised spot went numb. While still black, it no longer hurt.</p>
<p>Aerial taught me that grit isn’t glamorous. It’s not dramatic or cinematic. It’s boring. Repetitive. Often invisible. Progress usually feels like stagnation until—<em>suddenly</em>—it doesn’t.</p>
<p>That lesson has only grown more relevant since starting graduate school. Research often feels the same: like you’re spinning your wheels, revisiting the same questions, trying variations that still don’t quite work. But if you stay with it, tweaking your approach, listening to your instincts, persisting despite the bruises, you eventually find the hold.</p>
<h2>Learning from different management styles</h2>
<p>Serving on the aerial club’s executive board exposed me early on to how leadership style shapes group dynamics. For a couple of years, I was the social media chair—designing performance posters, creating Facebook events, and coordinating with photographers for our shows. But beyond those tasks, I was part of the broader decision-making team that kept the club running behind the scenes.</p>
<p>I wasn’t president, but I worked closely with the people who were. Each one brought a distinct approach to leadership. Some were assertive and highly structured, quick to make decisions and stick to timelines. Others were more easygoing and collaborative, inviting input and encouraging flexibility, even if it slowed things down. I saw how those choices affected the club’s morale, participation, and momentum. Too much control could stifle creativity; too little could lead to disorganization and frustration. The best leaders found a balance, or at least knew when to adapt based on the moment and the people involved.</p>
<p>This experience has deeply shaped how I think about academic mentorship. PIs, like club presidents, vary widely in how they lead. Some provide structure and top-down direction; others offer freedom but little guidance. Learning to work under (and around) different styles has helped me navigate research environments with more self-awareness and adaptability. I’ve come to understand what kind of structure helps me thrive, and where I need to create it for myself.</p>

<h2>Choreographing my own path</h2>
<p>Once I had the basics down, I started choreographing my own routines. There’s something deeply empowering about stringing moves together into a sequence that felt entirely mine. Unlike more formal dance disciplines, where a single choreographer teaches the group a set routine, aerial often encourages improvisation and experimentation. You pick your own music. You build your own story. You are your own choreographer.</p>
<p>I used to walk to class with earbuds in, listening to the playlist of songs I wanted to perform to. I’d imagine which transitions would hit with which lyrics, where a drop might land most dramatically, or how a pose could stretch just long enough to echo a swelling chorus. It was part puzzle, part daydream, part embodiment.</p>
<p>That creative freedom within a set of physical constraints mirrors how I’ve come to approach my research. One of the paradoxically liberating and anxiety-inducing things about graduate school is how little structure there really is. Every PhD experience is unique yet “the same” in that it highly depends on the individual. There’s no universal syllabus, no choreography to follow.</p>
<p>But that’s also where the opportunity lies. Leaning into that autonomy and learning to choreograph my own research journey has helped me feel less overwhelmed by the unknown, and more confident in what I can create. Like in aerial, I’ve come to trust that constraint can fuel creativity, and that structure doesn’t have to be handed to you in order to be meaningful.</p>

<h2>Collaborating closely to form ad-hoc conventions</h2>
<p>One of the quirks of aerial, especially compared to more formalized disciplines like ballet, is that there isn’t a universal naming system.  In ballet, a <em>tendu</em> is always a <em>tendu</em>. But in aerial, the same move might be called a “gazelle,” a “stag,” or something else entirely.</p>
<p>You can imagine how this lack of standardization can be confusing or inefficient: learning and teaching moves requires you to reach a consensus on a naming convention, to reduce uncertainty. It forces you to describe things precisely, to ask questions, to check your assumptions. It’s not unlike working in interdisciplinary research, where the same term can mean different things to different people (e.g., What is a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-020-02793-y" rel="nofollow"><em>representation</em></a>?). You can’t take shared vocabulary for granted. You have to build it.</p>
<p>That lesson became especially clear when I started performing with K, my duo hoop partner for all four years of college. Reflecting on this now, performing with K is probably my longest-running collaboration to date.</p>
<p>We learned to mirror, share weight, and build shapes together. But more than anything, we learned how to communicate. In the beginning, we had to talk through every detail: what move we were trying, who initiated it, where we’d make contact, and how we’d time our transitions. Communication was constant and deliberate.</p>
<p>And as we developed routines together, we also developed our own internal vocabulary. Since naming conventions in aerial aren’t standardized, especially in duo work, we created a kind of partner-specific shorthand. One example is a move we called “Tweedle Dee,” which we borrowed from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDKwNW8JBcw" rel="nofollow">a YouTube routine</a> we once saw, where the performers played Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum in an Alice in Wonderland–themed act. To anyone else, that name would be meaningless. But to us, “Tweedle Dee” instantly evoked a full sequence of coordinated movement: who initiated it, how it unfolded, where our weight shifted, what tempo to follow. It was an abstraction, a compact label for something deeply embodied.</p>
<p>Over time, this vocabulary allowed us to move together more fluidly, without having to explain every detail. Eventually, we didn’t need to talk at all. By the time we performed our final duo act, we were in sync from start to finish, able to anticipate each other’s timing, weight shifts, and intentions with near-perfect precision.</p>
<p>That shared understanding didn’t just make things easier either, it made things better. Our routines weren’t just functional, they were alive. They reflected a partnership that had been built over years of trust, improvisation, and collaboration. Because our communication and movement were so tightly integrated, our performances had a kind of rhythm and playfulness that felt uniquely us. Compared to solo acts, our routines offered something more unexpected—more dynamic, more relational, more fun to watch (or so I have been told!)</p>
<p>Reflecting on this now, I’m reminded of research on how people learn to coordinate through shared procedural abstractions. In particular, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00077" rel="nofollow">McCarthy et al. (2021)</a> found that when people repeatedly collaborate on a physical assembly task, they naturally begin to develop increasingly concise instructions by grounding language in shared, task-relevant conceptual structures. Over time, they form ad-hoc conventions that compress complex procedures into higher-level abstractions. That dynamic felt deeply familiar: K and I started with careful, explicit instructions, then gradually built up a shared vocabulary, rooted in mutual experience, that enabled seamless, efficient coordination. Our “Tweedle Dee” wasn’t just a name; it was a scaffold for joint understanding and collaborative movement. It was also creative expression that neither of us could have achieved alone.</p>
<p><img src="/images/aerial_group_photo.jpg" alt="group photo">
<em>A group photo of the aerial club from our water-themed show. K and I performed a “mermaid pirate love story” which you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77QowxvQCk4" rel="nofollow">here</a></em>.</p>
<h2>An interdisciplinary community of misfits</h2>
<p>One of the most unexpected gifts of aerial was the community it brought me into. Aerial spaces tend to attract people who never quite fit into traditional molds—a safe haven for anyone who’s ever dreamed of abandoning societal expectations and “running off to the circus.” It’s a space where things are stranger, more creative, more free. Everyone is weird in their own way, and no one’s trying to hide it.</p>
<p>In our club, that sense of acceptance was amplified by how wildly different our backgrounds were. Some of us came from dance or gymnastics. Others had been circus performers, ultimate frisbee players, martial artists, or even tree climbers. Everyone brought their own skills, strengths, and styles, and there was room for all of it. That kind of eclectic, non-hierarchical energy made it one of the first spaces where I felt truly comfortable taking up space—not because I was the best, but because being different was the norm.</p>
<p>In academia, finding that kind of community isn’t always easy. The structures are more rigid. The pressure to conform and to be impressive in a specific way is much higher. If you don’t see yourself reflected in your cohort, your department, or your field, it can feel deeply isolating.</p>
<p>But aerial gave me a blueprint for what belonging can feel like. It showed me the power of shared risk, mutual support, and celebrating difference as a strength. That experience informs how I try to show up in academic spaces now: seeking out collaborators who value openness and generosity, mentoring with empathy, and trying, when I can, to carve out small pockets of weirdness, honesty, and community for others.</p>
<h2>Curtain call</h2>
<p>So maybe it’s not vanity that brings me back to those old performance videos. Maybe it’s a way of remembering who I am and who I’ve always been becoming.</p>
<p>Aerial taught me to persist through pain, to experiment boldly, to communicate with care, and to seek out communities where I feel seen. It reminded me that mastery isn’t about sudden flashes of brilliance, but about showing up, day after day, even when the progress feels invisible. That naming things is messy. That collaboration is something you build. That being weird isn’t something to overcome but instead something to offer.</p>
<p>These lessons didn’t stay in the studio. They’ve followed me into the lab, into my writing, into my collaborations and the questions I care about. They shape how I move through academia: not with perfect grace, but with a kind of practiced stubbornness. A willingness to try again.</p>
<p>And when I feel lost or inadequate, I return to those memories, not just for nostalgia, but for perspective. I remember how many times I flailed before I flew. How much of progress looks like failure until one day it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Because if you fall enough times, and keep getting back up—you don’t just survive it.
You learn to fly.</p></article></div></main>
