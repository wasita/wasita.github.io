					Given our inability to share brains, we cannot directly access or perceive
					another's reality, which renders our experienced realities subjective
					and inherently "incomplete". With our subjective perspectives of the world
					and limited access to information causing uncertainty, how do we then
					adaptively interact with other individuals and collaborate with
					them to refine our mental models of the world? Verbal communication and other
					forms of interaction play essential roles in facilitating this collaboration,
					but what are the computational mechanisms underlying these processes? 
					My research is guided by these questions, and in answering them I use a
					combination of real-time multiplayer web experiments,
					natural language processing (NLP) tools, and computational modeling (primarily Bayesian inference).
