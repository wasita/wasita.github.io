					Our subjective realities are inherently limited, shaped by our personal perspectives and incomplete access to the experiences of others.
					How do we overcome the limitations of our own perspective to understand the minds of others and the shared experiences we have with them?
				</p>
				<p class="pt-4 text-left">
					To bridge the gap between our subjective realities, I study how we infer others' mental states through their communication behavior and how we align our mental states with others to achieve shared goals.
					These processes are foundational not only for coordinating actions with others but also for building and maintaining meaningful social connections.

					By leveraging real-time multiplayer web experiments, natural language processing (NLP), and computational modeling (primarily Bayesian cognitive modeling),
					I investigate the cognitive mechanisms that support our ability to co-construct mental models of the world with others.
