          I study how we make sense of other people's minds and their shared
          experiences.

          Our subjective realities are inherently limited, shaped by our
          personal perspectives and incomplete access to the experiences of
          others. How do we overcome the limitations of our own perspective to
          understand the minds of others and the shared experiences we have with
          them?

          To bridge the gap between our subjective realities, I study how we
          infer others' mental states through their communication behavior and
          how we align our mental states with others to achieve shared goals.
          These processes are foundational not only for coordinating actions
          with others but also for building and maintaining meaningful social
          connections.

          By leveraging real-time multiplayer web experiments, natural language
          processing (NLP), and computational modeling (primarily Bayesian
          cognitive modeling), I investigate the cognitive mechanisms that
          support our ability to co-construct mental models of the world with
          others.
