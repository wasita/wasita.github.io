					Prior to graduate school, I worked as the lab manager of 
					<a href="http://ski.clps.brown.edu/">Michael J. Frank</a>'s
					<a href="https://www.lnccbrown.com/">Lab of Neural Computation + Cognition</a>.
					My research focused on understanding how humans learn
					and make decisions under uncertainty, particularly within the context of
					psychiatric disorders and with a specific emphasis on obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).

					Before that, I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant in
					<a href="https://www.shenhavlab.org/">Amitai Shenhav's Lab</a>, where I studied performance monitoring and cognitive control
					within the context of task-switching.

					I was born in Bangkok, Thailand, grew up in Maine, and then lived in Rhode Island for several years for college and work.

					Outside of research, I enjoy ruminating while showering,
					cuddling with my kitty Joji (pictured above), and
					playing video games (currently obsessed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-5RXAitTI">Baldur's Gate 3</a>).
					In a past life, I practiced <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wasiaerial/">aerial hoop/lyra</a> regularly.
					Nowadays, I attend <a href="https://uvcircus.com/">UVCC</a> workshops when I can.
