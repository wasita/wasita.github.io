          I am currently a 5th year PhD candidate in the

            >Psychological & Brain Sciences department</a

            Computational Social Affective Neuroscience (COSAN) Lab</a
          >, where I work with

          Prior to graduate school, I worked as the lab manager of
          <a href="http://ski.clps.brown.edu/">Michael J. Frank</a>'s
          <a href="https://www.lnccbrown.com/"
            >Lab of Neural Computation + Cognition</a
          >. My research focused on understanding how humans learn and make
          decisions under uncertainty, particularly within the context of
          psychiatric disorders and with a specific emphasis on obsessive
          compulsive disorder (OCD).

          />
          Before that, I also worked as an undergraduate research assistant in
          <a href="https://www.shenhavlab.org/">Amitai Shenhav's Lab</a>, where
          I studied performance monitoring and cognitive control within the
          context of task-switching.

          I was born in Thailand, grew up in Maine, and then lived in Rhode
          Island for several years for college and work.

          Outside of research, I enjoy ruminating while showering, cuddling with
          my kitty Joji (pictured above), and playing video games (currently
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p-5RXAitTI"

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj-MRvcXHgw">Elden Ring</a>).
          In a past life, I practiced
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wasiaerial/">aerial hoop/lyra</a>.
          Nowadays, I attend <a href="https://uvcircus.com/">UVCC</a> workshops when
          I can.
