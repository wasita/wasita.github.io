## Points I want to make (in stream of consciousness)

![hip hang](/images/aerial_12_2015.jpg)

- Hip hang: Keep trying, trying, trying. Despite all the bruises.

- Observing different types of managing styles.

- Creative freedom in choreographing or own routines (as opposed to being told what to do like in more formal classes).

- Coordinating on names of moves. Less formalized than ballet or other types of dance.

- Accepting and supportive community of misfits.
