## Introducion: Aerial as more than just a hobby

- Introduce how I started aerial arts and why it captured my interest
- Describe how it became a consistent part of my life throughout college
- Mention how, looking back, I see unexpected parallels between aerial and research

## Lesson 1: The value of repeated failure (and bruises) -- the hip hang story

- Describe the struggle of learning the hip hang—how it seemed impossible at first.
- The physical toll (bruises, soreness, frustration) and the persistence required to get it right.
- Tie this to research: the process of revising hypotheses, failed experiments, debugging code—things often don’t work the first (or fifth) time, but persistence leads to breakthroughs.

## Lesson 2: Managing styles -- learning and working from different teachers and colleagues

- Compare aerial teachers and how they differ—some strict, some encouraging, some hands-off.
- How different styles of instruction affect learning, motivation, and confidence.
- Relate to your experience working with different PIs, collaborators, or mentors in research—adapting to different management styles, learning how you best receive feedback.

## Lesson 3: Creative freedom -- choreographing vs. following instructions

- The joy of choreographing my own routine vs. being in structured classes
- Whenever I'd listen to music, I'd imagine what move I'd do to certain parts of a song. I have a playlist of songs I'd wanted to perform to.
- Balancing between following traditional methods vs. developing novel approaches
- Creative problem-solving, finding new ways to transition between moves, improvisation, self-expression

## Lesson 4: Self-teaching

- Drawing inspiration from instagram videos

## Lesson 5: Navigating an informal yet functional language

- Lack of standardized terminology -- some moves had different names depending on who you asked

- Challenge of coordinating with others in practice or performance

- TODO: Have comparison viz of first duo performance with Kat and our last one, to demonstrate how in-sync we grew to be over time

## Lesson 6: The importance of mastering the fundamentals

- Conditioning. Warm up song to Bizarre Love Triangle.
- Despite its importance, I wasn't very good at regularly conditioning, hence my poor stamina and lack of routine
- Relate to my self-awareness of lacking statistic fundamental. Have always been drawn to learning new methods or flashy things first, above mastering fundamentals (oops)

## Lesson 7: Finding a community of misfits

- TODO: Add group photo from show here
- How aerialists come from diverse backgrounds (former dancers, dynamists, yogies, and tree climber!) but share a mutual respect and support for each other.
- The welcoming and non-judgmental nature of the community.
- Compare to academic research—finding your niche, seeking out like-minded people, and how intellectual communities can feel similarly tight-knit and supportive

## Conclusion

- Reflect on how aerial has shaped your mindset in resilience, adaptability, creative thinking, and collaboration.
- Encourage readers to think about how their non-academic passions influence their work in surprising ways.
- Maybe end with a playful line about how, whether in the air or in the lab, you’ve learned to embrace the falls as part of the process
