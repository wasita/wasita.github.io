<p>i often think about how we cannot access or perceive another's reality due to our inability to
  share brains, rendering our experienced realities subjective and "incomplete." as a
  result, i am primarily interested in the neurocomputational mechanisms
  underlying our brain's ability to extract relevant features from often noisy environments
  (especially in the social domain), allowing for adaptive learning and decision-making. i am
  also interested in individual differences in belief updating (i.e., the degree to which we
  integrate new information and uncertainty in updating our internal models of how the world
  works), event perception (e.g., how can people walk out of the same experience with different perceptions and feelings
  about it?), and memory, how we communicate this information to other people
  (e.g., when we indicate our confidence on an assessment of something when advising another),
  and how this all potentially connects to affective disorders.
  to explore these interests, i aim to use a combination of behavioral experiments, computational
  modeling, and neuroimaging.

<p>my current projects investigate 1) active information-seeking behavior and
  uncertainty computations in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and
  2) the impact of perceptual uncertainty on reward learning, subsequent memory retrieval,
  and behavioral adjustments.</p>
