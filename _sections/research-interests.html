<p>i often think about how we cannot access or perceive another's reality due to our inability to
  share brains, rendering our experienced realities subjective and "incomplete." for this reason, i am primarily
  interested in the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying our brain's ability to extract relevant features from
  noisy environments (especially the social domain, where another person's mind is arguably the ultimate form of
  uncertainty), allowing for adaptive learning and decision-making.</p>

<p>i am also interested in individual differences in belief updating (i.e., the degree to which we
  integrate new information and uncertainty in updating our internal models of how the world
  works) and how we remember and communicate information to other people, and how this all
  potentially connects to affective disorders. to explore these interests, i aim to use a combination of behavioral
  experiments, computational modeling, and neuroimaging.

<p>some of my pre-grad school projects, which have heavily informed my interests and training,
  investigate 1) active information-seeking behavior and
  uncertainty computations in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and
  2) the role of perceptual uncertainty in reward learning and episodic memory.</p>
