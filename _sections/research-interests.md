i often think about how we cannot access or perceive another's reality, given our inability to share brains, rendering our experienced realities subjective and "incomplete." with our individualized perspectives of the world and limited access to information, how do we then adaptively interact with other individuals and even collaborate with them to improve our mental models of the world? how does communication and other forms of interaction subserve this form of collaboration? and what are the computational mechanisms underlying these processes? my research is guided by these questions, and in answering them i use a combination of behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and neuroimaging.

in some of my pre-grad school projects, which have heavily informed my interests and training, i investigated 1) active information-seeking behavior and uncertainty computations in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) through a bayesian lens and 2) the influence of perceptual uncertainty on reward learning and episodic memory using reinforcement learning.
